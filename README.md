# Supplementary materials for master's thesis project, spring 2023

This repository contains the source code used for my master's thesis, _A comparative analysis of database sanitization techniques for privacy-preserving association rule mining_, written at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in the spring semester of 2023.

- `scripts`: contains Python and shell scripts used to perform various auxiliary tasks. These may be configured for a specific task, i.e., they do not represent a full automation of the task for the full set of data.
- `src`: contains the Java files for the three main algorithms.
- `synthetic_datasets`: contains the three synthetic datasets (syn1K, syn10K, syn100K) that were used in the experiment.

**NB:** The above files contain file paths that are specific to the local environment in which the tests were run. They will therefore require modification to be run on another machine.

Feel free to contact me upon discovery of bugs or other issues in the code.
